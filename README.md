High resolution wrapped phase estimation for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) using combined persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) processing.

<!-- DeformatiOn Land surface Products in High resolution using INsar -->

## Install

`dolphin` is available on conda:

```bash
# if mamba is not already installed, see here: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
mamba install -c conda-forge dolphin
```

`dolphin` has the ability to unwrap interferograms using several options:

1. [`snaphu-py`](https://github.com/isce-framework/snaphu-py), a lightweight Python bindings to [SNAPHU](https://web.stanford.edu/group/radar/softwareandlinks/sw/snaphu/). Available on both pip and conda.
2. [`isce3`](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce3)'s python bindings to SNAPHU, PHASS, or ICU
3. [`tophu`](https://github.com/isce-framework/tophu), a multi-scale unwrapper designed to unwrap large interferograms in parallel tiles at multiple resolution.

These may be installed via conda or (in the case of `snaphu-py`) pip.


To install locally:

1. Download source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin.git && cd dolphin
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
mamba env create --file conda-env.yml
```

or if you have an existing environment:

```bash
mamba env update --name my-existing-env --file conda-env.yml
```

3. Install `dolphin` via pip:

```bash
conda activate dolphin-env
python -m pip install .
```

Dolphin can also take advantage of CUDA-compatible GPUs for faster processing. [See the docs](https://dolphin-insar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gpu-setup) for installation instructions and configuration.

## Usage

The main entry point for configuring and running workflows the `dolphin` command line tool:

1. `dolphin config`: create a workflow configuration file.
2. `dolphin run` : run the workflow using this file.

Example usage:

```bash
dolphin config --slc-files /path/to/slcs/*tif
dolphin run dolphin_config.yaml
```

The `config` command creates a YAML file (by default `dolphin_config.yaml` in the current directory). If you'd like to see an empty YAML with all defaults filled in, you can run `dolphin config --print-empty`, which creates a [sample file like the one here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isce-framework/dolphin/refs/heads/main/docs/sample_dolphin_config.yaml)

The only required inputs for the workflow are the paths to the coregistered SLC files (in either geographic or radar coordinates).
If the SLC files are spread over multiple files, you can either

1. use the `--slc-files` option with a bash glob pattern, (e.g. `dolphin config --slc-files merged/SLC/*/*.slc` would match the [ISCE2 stack processor output](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2/tree/main/contrib/stack) )

1. Store all input SLC files in a text file delimited by newlines (e.g. `my_slc_list.txt`), and give the name of this text file prefixed by the `@` character (e.g. `dolphin config --slc-files @my_slc_list.txt`)

The full set of options is written to the configuration file; you can edit this file, or you can see which commonly tuned options by are changeable running `dolphin config --help`.

See the [documentation](https://dolphin-insar.readthedocs.io/) for more details.

## Building and running via Docker

`dolphin` can also be run using Docker. You can use the one built on [Github](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/pkgs/container/dolphin), or build it locally using the script

```bash
./docker/build-docker-image.sh
```

See `./docker/build-docker-image.sh --help` for more building options.
