- Added ability to read rasters on S3 using `VRTStack` object
- Eigenvalue solver speedups of 3-9x
- Initial version of 3D unwrapping using `spurt`

### Removed
- the KL-divergence SHP estimator has been removed. GLRT is recommended instead.

### Fixed

- The output SHP rasters now output 0 if there was no valid input data
- Logic for filling PS pixels, with and without setting the amplitudes to be the original SLC amplitudes
- `ReferencePointError` during the displacement workflow now will fall back look only at the `condition_file` (i.e. choose the point with highest temporal coherence by default)

### Changed
- The configuration options for unwrapping have been refactored. Options unique to each unwrapper are grouped into subclasses.
  - Note that older `dolphin_config.yaml` files will error after this refactor.
- Unweighted time series inversion will make one batch call, providing a large speedup over the `vmap` version for weighted least squares

### Added
- Added Goldstein filtering for unwrapping
- Added Interpolation for unwrapping
- Added the regrow connected components for the modified phase
- Added option to toggle off inversion
- Added similarity module

### Fixed
- 3D readers would squeeze out a dimension for length one inputs (i.e. they would give an array with `.ndim=2`)
- `max_bandwidth` config can now be 1 to specify only nearest neighbor interferograms.
- Use the 'compressed' key term to find compressed slcs and regular slcs instead of number of dates in ionosphere
- Consider the compressed SLCs have different naming convention with capital letters
- Enforce consistency between jax and jaxlib
- Disable corrections part of pytest, add one for timeseries

## [0.16.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.15.3...v0.16.0) - 2024-03-03

### Added

  - Estimate a (weighted) linear velocity from a timeseries
- Added inversion and velocity estimation as options to `DisplacementWorkflow`
- Create `DatasetStackWriter` protocol, with `BackgroundStackWriter` implementation

### Changed
- Rename `GdalWriter` to `BackgroundBlockWriter`
- Displacement workflow now also creates/returns a stitched, multi-looked version of the amplitude dispersion

### Fixed
- `BackgroundRasterWriter`  was not creating the files necessary before writing
- Allow user to specify more than one type of interferogram in `Network` configuration

# [0.15.3](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.15.2...0.15.3) - 2024-02-27

# [0.15.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.14.1...0.15.0) - 2024-02-16

### Changed

- Combine the nodata region with the `mask_file` to pass through to unwrappers
- Update regions which are nodata in interferograms to be nodata in unwrapped phase
- Use `uint16` data type for connected component labels

### Fixed

- Intersection of nodata regions for SLC stack are now all set to `nan` during phase linking, avoiding 0 gaps between bursts

# [0.14.1](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.14.0...0.14.1) - 2024-02-15

### Fixed

- Changed snaphu-py tile defaults to avoid max secondary arcs error in #233
- Fixed `linalg.norm`` to be pixelwise in `process_coherence_matrices` in #234

- Turn off default `beta=0.01` regularization now that CPL is in place
- Removed `InterferogramNetworkType` from configuration.
  - You can add multiple types of network parameters and it includes all of them. Adding the name only decreased flexibility.

# [0.13.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0) - 2024-02-09

### Added

- `_overviews` module, and workflow configuration to create overviews of the output stitched rasters
- Configuration to use the [snaphu-py](https://github.com/isce-framework/snaphu-py) wrapper, and drop using `isce3.unwrap.snaphu`

### Fixed

- Apply bounds even if only one image is passed to `stitching` (#210)
- Allow `take_looks` to work with `MaskedArrays` without converting to `np.ndarray`

### Dependencies

- Move back to `tqdm` instead of using `rich` for progress bars.

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0) - 2024-02-01

### Added
- Added `DatasetWriter` protocol
- Added `RasterWriter` and `BackgroundRasterWriter` implementations of this protocol
- Refactored phase linking
  - Covariance and EVD/MLE use `jax`
  - This combines the implementation of CPU/GPU, and removes the need for usign `pymp`
- Added `utils.disable_gpu` to stop the use ofr a GPU even if it's available

### Changed
- Internal module organization, including grouping IO modules into `dolphin.io` subpackage
- Renamed `io.Writer` to `io.GdalWriter` to distinguish from `RasterWriter`
- Removed the `n_workers` option from the configuration.
  - There is no more need to have two levels of parallelism (`threads_per_worker` and `n_workers`)
  - The name `threads_per_worker` is kept for consistency; it is still an accurate name for the multi-burst processing case.


### Added
- `jax`>=0.4.19
- `numpy`=>1.23 (bump to minimum version that they're still supporting)
- `scipy`>=1.9 (same reason)
- `numba`>=0.54

### Removed
- `pymp`
- `cupy` from optional GPU usage

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0) - 2024-01-24

### Added
- Added ionospheric correction in `dolphin.atmosphere.ionosphere`
  - Included in `DisplacementWorkflow` if TEC files are provided

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0) - 2024-01-22

### Added
- Create `dolphin.unwrap` subpackage to split out unwrapping calls, and post-processing modules.

### Removed
- the `_dates` module has been removed in favor of using `opera_utils._dates`

### Fixed
- `stitching.merge_images` will now give consistent sizes for provided bounds when `strides` is given

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0) - 2024-01-10

### Added
- `DatasetReader` and `StackReader` protocols for reading in data from different sources
  - `DatasetReader` is for reading in a single dataset, like one raster image.
  - `StackReader` is for reading in a stack of datasets, like a stack of SLCs.
  - Implementations of these have been done for flat binary files (`BinaryReader`), HDF5 files (`HDF5Reader`), and GDAL rasters (`RasterReader`).

### Changed
- The `VRTStack` no longer has an `.iter_blocks` method
  - This has been replaced with creating an `EagerLoader` directly and passing it to the `reader` argument

### Dependencies
- Added `rasterio>=1.3`

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) - 2024-01-05

### Added
- Ability to unwrap interferograms with the [`snaphu-py`](https://github.com/isce-framework/snaphu-py) (not a required dependency)
- Added ability to make annual ifgs in `Network`
- Start of tropospheric corection support in `dolphin.atmosphere` using PyAPS and Raider packages
- Expose the unwrap skipping with `dolphin config --no-unwrap`

### Changed
- The output directory for interferograms is now just "interferograms/" instead of "interferograms/stiched"
  - Even when stitching, the burst-wise interferograms would be in the named phase-linking subfolders.
- Split apart the `dolphin.workflows.stitch_and_unwrap` module into `stitching_bursts` and `unwrapping`
- Switched output filename from `tcorr` to `temporal_coherence` for the temporal coherence of phase linking.
  - Also added the date span to the `temporal_coherence` output name
- The default extension for conncomps is now `.tif`. Use geotiffs instead of ENVI format for connected components.
- Using ruff instead of pydocstyle due to archived repo

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.6.1...v0.7.0) - 2023-11-29

### Added
- `MiniStackPlanner` and `MiniStackInfo` class which does the planning for how a large stack of SLCs will be processed in batches.
  - Previously this was done at run time in `sequential.py`. We want to separate that out to view the plan in advance/allow us to dispatch the work to multiple machines.
- `CompressedSlcInfo` class added to track the attributes of a compressed SLC file created during the workflow.
  - This has the `reference_date` as an attribute, which allows us to know what the base phase is even without starting from
    the first SLC in the stack (i.e. if we have limited the number of compressed SLCs)
- Added better/more complete metadata to the compressed SLC Geotiff tags, including the phase reference date
  - Before we were relying on the filename convention, which was not enough information
- config: `phase_linking.max_compressed_slcs` to cap the number of compressed SLCs added during large-stack sequential workflows
- `interferogram`: Add ability to specify manual dates for a `Network`/`VRTInterferogram`, which lets us re-interfere the phase-linking results

### Changed
- Date functions have been moved from `dolphin.utils` to `dolphin._dates`. They are accessible at `dolphin.get_dates`, etc
- `get_dates` now uses `datetime.datetime` instead of `datetime.date`.
  - This is to allow for more flexibility in the date parsing, and to allow for the use of `datetime.date` or `datetime.datetime` in the output filenames.
- `VRTStack` has been moved to `_readers.py`. The minstack planning functions have been removed to focus the class on just reading input GDAL rasters.

### Fixed
- When starting with Compressed SLCs in the list of input SLCs, the workflows will now recognize them, find the correct reference date, and form all the correct interferograms

### Removed
- Extra subsetting functions from `VRTStack` have been removed, as they are not used in the workflow and the reimplmenent simple GDAL calls.
- `CPURecorder` and `GPURecorder` have been removed to simplify code. May be moved to separate repo.

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1) - 2023-11-13

### Removed
- `dolphin.opera_utils` now lives in the separate package

### Dependencies
- Added `opera_utils`

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.5.1...v0.6.0) - 2023-11-07

### Added
- `opera_utils.get_missing_data_options` to parse the full list of SLCs and return possible subsets which have the same dates used for all Burst IDs
- `PsWorkflow` class for running just the PS estimation workflow
- `asv` benchmark setup to measure runtime across versions
- `@atomic_output` decorator for long running write processes, to avoid partially-written output files

### Changed
- removed `minimum_images` as an argument from `opera_utils.group_by_burst`. Checking for too-few images now must be done by the caller
- `opera_utils.group_by_burst` now matches the official product name more robustly, but still returns the lowered version of the burst ID.
- The `s1_disp` workflow has been renamed to `displacement`, since it is not specific to Sentinel-1.
- The configuration was refactored to enable smaller workflow
  - The `Workflow` config class has been renamed to `DisplacementWorkflow`.
  - A `PsWorkflow` config class has been added for the PS estimation workflow.
  - A `WorkflowBase` encompasses some of the common configuration options.

### Maintenance
- `ruff` has replaced `isort`/`black`/`flake8` in the pre-commit checks

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1) - 2023-10-10

### Added
- `stitch_and_unwrap.run` returns the stitch PS mask

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.4.3...v0.5.0) - 2023-10-09

### Added
- `CPURecorder` class for fine grained benchmarking of the CPU/memory usage for

### Changed
- Docker `specfile` now builds with tophu

## [0.4.3](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.4.2...v0.4.3) - 2023-10-06

### Added
- Ability to unwrap using isce3's `PHASS`
- `CorrectionOptions` model for specifying the correction options in the `Workflow` config
  - Currently a placeholder for the files which will be used for tropospheric/ionospheric corrections
- Ability to keep relative files in the `Workflow` config
  - This is useful for keeping the relative paths to the SLCs in the config, and then running the workflow from a different directory

### Changed

- Instead of specifying the unwrapping algorithm in `dolphin unwrap` as `--use-icu`, the option is not `--unwrap-method`
  - This let's us add `--unwrap-method "phass"`, but also future unwrap methods without a `--use-<name>` for every one
- Use `spawn` instead of `fork` for parallel burst multiprocessing
  - This leads to the error `Terminating: fork() called from a process already using GNU OpenMP, this is unsafe.`
    in certain situations, and does not happen with `spawn`. See https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-multiprocessing/ for more details.


# [0.4.2](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2) - 2023-10-03

### Added
- `use_evd` option to force the use of eigenvalue decomposition instead of the EMI phase linking algorithm
- Walkthrough tutorial notebook

### Changed

- Moved all `OPERA_` variables to a new module `dolphin.opera_utils`.
  - Other OPERA-specific quirks have been moved to the separate `disp-s1` repo,
     but the functions remaining are the ones that seem most broadly useful to `sweets`
     and other users working with burst SLCs.
  - Changed the burst regex to be able to match COMPASS and the official product name
- Removed `WorkflowName` for separating `stack` vs `single`
  - The name didn't really provide benefit, as the real differences cam from other configuration options
- Internals for which functions are called in `sequential.py`
- Docker image now has `tophu` installed

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) - 2023-09-08

### Dependencies
- Added back isce3

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) - 2023-09-07


### Changed

- Split apart OPERA-specific needs from more general library/workflow functionality
- Removed the final NetCDF product creation
  - Many rasters in the `scratch/` folder are of general interest after running the workflow
  - Changed folder structure so that there's not longer a top-level `scratch/` and `output/` by default
- Changed the required dependencies so the `isce3` unwrapper is optional, as people may wish to implement their own custom parallel unwrapping

### Dependencies

Dropped:
- h5netcdf
- pillow

Now optional:
- isce3 (for unwrapping)

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) - 2023-08-23

### Added

- Save a multilooked version of the PS mask for output inspection

### Changed

- Pydantic models were upgraded to V2
- Refactored the blockwise IO into `_blocks.py`.
  - The iteration now happens over the output grid for easier dilating/padding when using `strides`
  - New classes with `BlockIndices` and `BlockManager` for easier mangement of the different slices

### Dependencies

- pydantic >= 2.1

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) - 2023-07-25

### Added

- For OPERA CSLC inputs, we now read the nodata polygon and skip loading regions of the SLC stack which are all nodata.
  - This led to a reduction of 30-50% in wrapped phase estimation runtime for each burst stack.
- Sample test data for the `dolphin` package loaded onto Zenodo.
- Adds 3 methods of computing a variable statistically homogeneous pixel (SHP) window when estimating the covariance matrix:
  - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test)
  - Generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)
  - Kullback-Leibler divergence/distance test (KLD)
  - `"rect"` is also an option for skipping any statistical test and using the full rectangular multilook window
- Also included a script to view the window in an interactive matplotlib figure (matplotlib must be installed separately)
- Added a simple method to check for adjacent-pixel unwrapping errors in `unwrap.compute_phase_diffs`
- Adds a method `utils.get_cpu_count` which returns either `os.cpu_count`, or (if running in a Docker container) the number of CPUs allocated by Docker
- If processing stacks from separate bursts, added option `n_parallel_bursts` to `Workflow` to run in parallel processes.
- Created a script to test the incremental/near-real-time version of phase linking
- Added a new CLI command `dolphin unwrap` to unwrap a single interferogram/a directory of interferograms in parallel.
- Added ability to specify a glob pattern for input CSLC files in the YAML config
- Saves a multilooked PS mask for the default workflow output
- Allows the user to specify a desired bounds for the final stitched result

**Changes**

- Default OPERA dataset is now within `/data`, reflecting the new COMPASS product spec since CalVal
- Passing an existing file to `VRTStack` will no longer error unless `fail_on_overwrite=True`. The default just prints out the overwrite is happening. This prevents multiple runs in the same folder from errorings just for creating a reference to the SLC files.
- The environment variable `NUMBA_NUM_THREADS` is set using the passed in config to prevent numba from using all CPUs during `prange` calls
- The `sequential.py` module uses a different implementation of the sequential estimator to avoid the need for a datum adjustment.
- The scratch directory holding unwrapped interferograms is named `unwrapped` instead of `unwrap`
- Stitching files now can accept downsampled versions and product the correct geo metadata

### Fixed

- Calculating the nodata mask using the correct input geotransform
- Trims the overlapped region of the phase linking step when iterating in blocks

### Dependencies

- shapely >= 1.8
- Numba now supports Python 3.11, so we can drop the Python<3.11 version restriction.

Added testing requirements:
- pooch
- pillow>=7.0


## [0.1.0](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.0.4...v0.1.0) - 2023-03-31

- First version of the `_product.py` module to output the combined NetCDF product file.
- `_pge_runconfig.py` module to handle the separate PGE-compatible configuration, which translates to-from the `Workflow` object.
- `docker/build-docker-image.sh` script to build the docker image.
- Release scripts for generating documentation, script for validating output data by @gmgunter .
- Use of a spatial correlation estimate for unwrapping purposes, rather than temporal coherence.
  - This is much more useful when the stack size is small (high temporal coherence), and `snaphu` is used for unwrapping.
- `masking.py` module for masking the interferogram/combined multiple external masks of varying 1/0 conventions.
- Ability to use existing amplitude mean/dispersion files for the PS portion of the workflow, skipping the step where we compute it using the SLC stack. Useful for small stack sizes
- Added a `create_only` option to `write_arr` to create an empty file without writing data (e.g. to check the boundary results of stitching)


### Changed
- The YAML output/input functions are moved to a `YamlModel` class, which is a subclass of `pydantic.BaseModel`.
  - This allows us to use it in both `config.py` and `_pge_runconfig.py`.
- Refactoring of the `Workflow` layout to more easily extract the input/output files for the PGE run.

### Fixed

- Compressed SLC outputs were getting corrupted upon writing when using strides > 1.
- Single-update interferograms where the first SLC input is a compressed SLC was broken (using the wrong size raster).
  - Now the result will simply copy over the phase-linking result, which is already referenced to the first raster.

### Dependencies

Added requirements:

- h5netcdf>=1.1
- Avoid HDF5 version 1.12.1 until NetCDF loading issue is fixed

## [0.0.4](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.0.3...v0.0.4) - 2023-03-17

### Added

- Created first version of the single-update workflow, usable with `dolphin config --single`
- `_background.py` module as the abstract classes for background input/output with `EagerLoader` and `Writer`.
- `from_vrt_file` for the `VRTInterferogram` class.
- Arbitrary interferogram index selection in `Network` class.
- Parallel CPU eigenvector finding using `scipy.linalg.eigh`.
- PS selection for strided outputs using the average PS phase within a window (that contains multiple PS).
- Comments in the YAML file output by the `dolphin config` command.


### Changed

- The main workflow has been renamed to `s1_disp.py` to better reflect the workflow, since it can handle both single and stack workflows.
    - The `sequential.py` and `single.py` are where these differences are handled.
- More uniform naming in `io.get_raster_<X>` functions.
- The SLC compression is now done in `_compress.py` to declutter the `mle.py` module.
- Replace `tqdm` with `rich` for progress bars.
- The `unwrap.py` module now uses isce3 to unwrap the interferogram.

- Docs are now using the mkdocs `material` theme.

### Removed

- `utils.parse_slc_strings` in favor of always using `utils.get_dates`.
- `io.get_stack_nodata_mask`. This will be done using the nodata polygon, or not at all.


### Dependencies

Added requirements:

- rich>=12.0
- threadpoolctl>=3.0
- isce3>=0.8.0
- pyproj>=3.3
- Dropped support for Python 3.7

For docs:
- mkdocs-material
- pymdown-extensions

Removed requirements:

- tqdm


## [0.0.3](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.3) - 2023-01-26

### Added

- Ability for `VRTStack` to handle HDF5 files with subdatasets.
    - The OPERA specific HDF5 files are now supported without extra configuration.
- First stitching of interferograms in `stitching.py`.
    - Users can pass multiple SLC burst (like COMPASS bursts) per date, and the workflow will process per stack then stitch per date.
- More features for `load_gdal` to load in blocks.

### Changed

- A small amount of regularization on the coherence matrix is done before inversion during phase linking to avoid singular matrices.
- Renamed module to `_log.py`
- `workflows/wrapped_phase.py` absorbed much logic formerly in `s1_disp_stack.py`.

## [0.0.2](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2) - 2023-01-24

### Added

- Created first version of the `s1_disp_stack.py` workflow.
- Created the modules necessary for first version of the sequential workflow, including
    - `ps.py`
    - `sequential.py`
    - `io.py`
    - `interferogram.py`
    - `utils.py`
    - `unwrap.py`
    - `stitching.py`
    - `vrt.py`
- Created the `phase_link` subpackage for wrapped phase estimation.


Added requirements:

- pyproj>=3.2
- tqdm>=4.60


## [0.0.1] - 2022-12-09

### Added

- Created the `config` module to handle the configuration of the workflows
- Command line interface for running the workflows
- Outline of project structure and utilities


### Dependencies

Added requirements:

- gdal>=3.3
- h5py>=3.6
- numba>=0.54
- numpy>=1.20
- pydantic>=1.10
- pymp-pypi>=0.4.5
- ruamel_yaml>=0.15
- scipy>=1.5

Currently, Python 3.7 is supported, but 3.11 is not due numba not yet supporting Python 3.11.
